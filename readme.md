- install with npm install
(node needs to be installed)

- compile with tsc -w in the root.
(typescript compiler is bundled but follow official docs as I have it installed globally if that does not work)

- serve with http-server
(insall with npm install -g http-server)

http://localhost:8080/

note:
this is a playground, made on sept 10th 2017 from scratch.
no quickstart, no angular cli. by going through all the pain to understand and wire things so that they work.

there are a few issues reported in vs code...but I gues they are due to wrong versioning of certain items...things work for me though.
